# EECS-113-Final-Project

Final Project for UCI EECS 113

This project was to develop a Raspberry Pi based IoT device to implement a weather monitoring system. The data from this monitoring system would be used to decide on how much water is needed to irrigate and turn on a sprinkler system. It would pull data from a CIMIS system, or a weather station database in California.
